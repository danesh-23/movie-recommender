## What is it?

A movie recommender system that recommends movies from the 1900s(<2000s) based on movies in that time period that you liked.

## Getting Started

1. [Download the file here](https://github.com/danesh-23/movie-recommender/archive/master.zip) as a zip or git clone it using the command below.
```
git clone https://github.com/danesh-23/movie-recommender.git
```

2. Run the movie-recommender.py file in any IDE such as Pycharm, Eclipse, Atom etc. and it requires an input of a list of movies you liked.(a lot)

3. The movie names in the input file must be formatted {movie_name,} {The} {Year Released to general public} if a "The" is present in movie name; otherwise in format of {movie_name} {Year Released to general public}.

## A little about this project

I created this mini-project while I was delving into basic Machine Learning techniques and I found it really interesting how I could perform profoundly simple tasks in real life, such as guessing the movies a person would like based on some movies you already know they like, but otherwise impossible to perform without some form of machine learning. So, I decided to share the fun I had putting this together and I figured it'd do more justice to the code to be on Github(possibly for others to learn) rather than being buried with tons of other python files. I do intend to improve the usability of this program by eliminating the need for specific kinds of formatting in movie names given specified in the Getting Started guide. Hope you enjoy and learn a little :)
